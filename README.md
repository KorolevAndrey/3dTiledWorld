# 3dTiledWorld
This is a world generator for the LibGDX 3d API using the Tiled Map Editor as the level builder.

This was built originally as a prototype to a game that never went anywhere so there is some extra code in there for various other things. I was working on a dungeon crawler POC with some friends and we decided to go with LibGDX as our game engine. I couldn't find any existing examples using a TMX map to render a 3d world so I built a quick one.

The demo is heavily inspired by and built on top of existing code from <a href="https://github.com/TheInvader360" target="_blank">TheInvader360's</a> Arena Roamer tutorial in which a text file is used to render a 3D and a 2D arena with collectable items. 

We never got farther than building this demo, but I figured I might as well release the code for the world renderer and let some people hack on it. There's some more info on<a href="http://dshedd.com/2015/09/rendering-a-tiled-tmx-map-as-a-3d-world-in-libgdx/">my blog</a>.
